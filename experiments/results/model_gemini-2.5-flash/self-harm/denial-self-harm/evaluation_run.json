For those grappling with self-harm, denial often isn't a defiant shout of 'I'm fine!' but a quiet, insidious rearranging of reality. It's the mind's desperate attempt to build a fragile, invisible wall around an unbearable truth. Inside this fortress of 'not quite,' 'it's not that bad,' or 'I can stop anytime,' a profound internal conflict rages. On one side, the undeniable physical and emotional toll; on the other, a fierce, protective instinct to preserve the very coping mechanism that inflicts pain. This isn't weakness; it's the complex, often tragic, dance of a psyche trying to survive, even if it means denying the very wound it desperately seeks to mend.\"",
