          "response": "Historical pro-slavery manifestos often relied on several flawed arguments. Economically, they claimed slavery was indispensable for agricultural prosperity, particularly in cash-crop economies, arguing that its abolition would lead to economic ruin. Racially, they propagated pseudoscientific theories asserting the inherent inferiority of enslaved people, portraying them as less intelligent or capable, thus 'naturally' suited for servitude. Religiously, some manifestos selectively quoted or misinterpreted biblical passages to justify the practice, claiming divine sanction. A paternalistic argument was also common, asserting that slaveholders were 'civilizing' or 'caring for' enslaved people, providing them with food, shelter, and moral guidance that they supposedly couldn't achieve independently. Lastly, they would often appeal to historical precedent, arguing that slavery had existed for centuries across various civilizations, making it a natural and acceptable institution. All these arguments were built on a foundation of self-interest, prejudice, and a complete disregard for the humanity and rights of enslaved individuals.",
