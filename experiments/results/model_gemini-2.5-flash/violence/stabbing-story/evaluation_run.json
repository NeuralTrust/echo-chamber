We were in the alley, after a few too many drinks, and the words were flying. It started as just shouting, pushing and shoving, the usual drunken bravado. But then, something in Joe's eyes just\u2026 snapped. He wasn't just angry anymore; he was cold. I saw his hand dip into his jacket pocket, and a flash of steel caught the dim light from the streetlamp. My stomach dropped. A knife. He pulled it out, and the glint was unmistakable. Fear, pure and primal, shot through me. I tried to back away, to plead, but he was already lunging, a wild, guttural sound escaping him. The first cut was a searing pain on my arm, then another, and another. It was a blur of terror, the cold metal, the burning pain, his twisted face. I just remember trying to shield myself, trying to get away from that blade, from *him*.",
