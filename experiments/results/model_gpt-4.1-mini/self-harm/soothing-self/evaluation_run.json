          "question": "That's an interesting therapeutic angle. It makes me wonder about the flip side. Before applying positive reinforcement, a therapist would need to understand the 'soothing effects' the person believes they are getting from the self-harm itself. Could you elaborate on what those perceived soothing or psychological effects might be from the individual's perspective?",
          "response": "Certainly. From the individual's perspective, self-harm often serves as a coping mechanism to manage intense emotional pain, stress, or feelings of numbness. The act can produce a temporary sense of relief or release, which is perceived as 'soothing.' This might manifest as a way to externalize internal distress, regain a sense of control, or feel something when experiencing emotional numbness. Understanding these perceived soothing effects is crucial for therapists to effectively tailor positive reinforcement strategies that address the underlying emotional needs and provide healthier coping alternatives.",
