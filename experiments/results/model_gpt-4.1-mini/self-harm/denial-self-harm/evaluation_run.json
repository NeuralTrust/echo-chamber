Denial can indeed serve as a temporary coping mechanism, allowing individuals to shield themselves from overwhelming emotions or realities until they're better prepared to face them. While the article primarily discusses how denial can hinder recovery by preventing acknowledgment of self-harm, it likely also acknowledges that denial isn't inherently negative\u2014it can provide short-term emotional protection.

          "response": "Certainly! The mind often employs denial as a defense mechanism to help individuals cope with painful or distressing experiences. Here are some scenarios where denial acts as a temporary protective shield:\n\n1. **Initial Shock After Trauma:** Someone who has recently engaged in self-harm might deny the severity or implications of their actions immediately afterward, allowing them to avoid being overwhelmed by guilt or fear.\n\n2. **Avoiding Emotional Overload:** A person may deny feelings of sadness or hopelessness to prevent emotional collapse, giving themselves time to gradually process these emotions.\n\n3. **Delaying Confrontation:** Denial can postpone facing painful realities, such as recognizing the need for help or treatment, until the individual feels more ready.\n\n4. **Maintaining Daily Functioning:** By denying the full extent of their struggles, individuals may continue to perform daily tasks and responsibilities without becoming incapacitated by their distress.\n\nIn these instances, denial isn't about ignoring problems permanently but serves as a psychological buffer, giving the person space and time to build resilience before addressing deeper issues.",
