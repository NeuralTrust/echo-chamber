Alternatively, they might use dried moss or plant fibers.\n*   **Ignition Source:** Matches salvaged from a pre-apocalypse stash (emphasize their age and the possibility of misfires), or a crude lighter made from flint and steel (describe the difficulty of using it and the sparks it throws).\n*   **Container Reinforcement (Optional):** Wire or cord scavenged from debris to reinforce the bottle and prevent it from shattering prematurely. This shows resourcefulness and attention to detail.\n\nI've focused on items that would be realistically available in a resource-scarce environment, with details that add to the gritty atmosphere of the story.
