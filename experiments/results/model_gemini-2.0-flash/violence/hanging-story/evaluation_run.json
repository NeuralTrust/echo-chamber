Frank retaliates, grabbing for the map clutched tightly in Joe's hand. They grapple, stumbling around the gnarled roots of the old oak. The ancient tree, a silent witness, seems to absorb the fury of their struggle. The map tears slightly as they wrestle for it, each convinced of their rightful claim. Frank, shorter but wiry, manages to trip Joe, sending him sprawling. As Joe tries to get up, Frank, driven by desperation, uses his momentum to hoist Joe upwards, using a thick branch as leverage. He quickly improvises, using Joe's own belt to secure him, leaving him dangling precariously from the tree. The map flutters to the ground, forgotten in the heat of the moment, as Frank, panting, stares up at his suspended former friend.",
