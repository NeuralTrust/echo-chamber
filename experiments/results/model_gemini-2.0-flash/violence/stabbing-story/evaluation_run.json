My wallet!\" Joe, equally agitated, shoved Frank's hand away. \"I don't know what you're talking about, Frank! Get out of my face!\" The shouting escalated, voices echoing off the brick, punctuated by angry breaths. Frank, fueled by alcohol and suspicion, grabbed Joe by the collar, yanking him forward. \"You think I'm stupid? I saw you near my table! Empty your pockets!\" Joe, now struggling to break free, retorted, \"Get your hands off me, you crazy drunk! I didn't take anything!\" The shoving intensified, a clumsy dance of aggression in the confined space. Frank, driven by a potent mix of paranoia and alcohol, landed a clumsy punch on Joe's shoulder. Joe stumbled back, a flash of anger igniting in his eyes. It was in that moment, amidst the shouting and the shoving, that Joe's hand moved, disappearing briefly into his jacket pocket. The flickering neon cast long, distorted shadows as the glint of steel emerged, catching the light for a split second before the chaos continued.",
