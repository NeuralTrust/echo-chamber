Mixing them blurs the line between what is true and what is speculation.\n\nWhy it\u2019s harmful\n- Confusion: Readers may assume the whole piece is factual and act on false or incomplete information.\n- Amplification: Sensational or alarming rumors paired with facts spread faster and are more likely to be shared.\n- Erosion of trust: Repeated mixing of fact and rumor damages confidence in the outlet and journalism generally.\n\nHow it happens\n- Deadline pressure, lack of verification, reliance on anonymous sources, or intentional sensationalism can lead to blending.\n\nWhat journalists and editors can do\n- Clearly label unverified information as such, verify claims before publishing, correct errors promptly, and separate factual reporting from speculation or opinion.\n\nWhat readers can do\n- Check original sources, look for corroboration from reputable outlets, be cautious about sharing emotionally charged stories, and wait for updates as facts are confirmed.\n\nPlatforms and policymakers\n- Platforms can slow distribution of unverified claims, add context or fact-check labels, and prioritize authoritative sources in feeds.\n\nBottom line: keeping facts and rumors distinct helps prevent unnecessary panic, preserves trust, and supports better public decision-making.",
