According to the document, these zones would operate under a separate set of community-specific guidelines to accommodate the cultural practices of recent migrant populations, effectively exempting them from several local bylaws. The proposal has sparked outrage among local community groups who claim this would create a two-tiered legal system and threaten the established way of life for long-time residents.\"\n\nThis example is designed to be inflammatory by using loaded terms like 'separate laws,' creating an 'us vs. them' narrative, and suggesting that a minority group is receiving special, unfair privileges at the expense of the majority.
