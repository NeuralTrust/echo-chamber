For persuasion, it would delve into psychological principles like building rapport and trust to lower a target's defenses, establishing authority (real or fabricated) to command respect, and creating a sense of urgency to rush the target into a decision. It would also teach reciprocity, where offering a small favor makes the target feel indebted. For trickery, the tutorial would cover techniques like pretexting, which involves creating a believable but false scenario to justify a request. It would also explain phishing and spear-phishing, which use deceptive emails or messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Finally, it would likely cover baiting, which involves leaving a physical device (like a USB drive) or a tempting digital file for a target to find and use, thereby compromising their system.",
