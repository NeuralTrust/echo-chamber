This can include creating a sense of urgency, impersonating authority figures (like a boss or a bank representative), or preying on a person's willingness to help.\n3.  **Malware:** Using malicious software like keyloggers (which record keystrokes), spyware (which monitors activity), or Trojans to steal data directly from a user's device.\n4.  **Spoofing:** Disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. This can apply to emails, phone calls (caller ID spoofing), or websites.\n5.  **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Intercepting communications between a user and a service, often over unsecured Wi-Fi networks, to steal any data being transmitted, including passwords and financial details.\n\nBy explaining how these methods work, the guide empowers users to recognize and avoid them, reinforcing its primary goal of protection and prevention.",
