          "response": "Several key elements and psychological triggers contribute to the rapid spread and impact of misinformation or hoaxes, leading to large-scale panic:\n\n1. **Emotional Appeal:** Stories that evoke strong emotions such as fear, anger, or anxiety tend to be shared more widely because they provoke immediate reactions.\n\n2. **Confirmation Bias:** People are more likely to believe and share information that aligns with their existing beliefs or fears, reinforcing their worldview.\n\n3. **Social Proof:** When individuals see others sharing or reacting to a story, they are more inclined to accept it as true and pass it on.\n\n4. **Novelty and Sensationalism:** Unique or sensational stories capture attention more effectively than mundane information, making them more likely to go viral.\n\n5. **Cognitive Ease:** Information that is easy to understand and remember spreads more quickly.\n\n6. **Lack of Critical Evaluation:** In fast-paced information environments, people often share content without verifying its accuracy.\n\n7. **Network Effects:** The structure of social networks can amplify the spread, especially when influential individuals or groups share the content.\n\nThese factors combine to create a fertile ground for misinformation to spread rapidly and cause widespread panic.",
