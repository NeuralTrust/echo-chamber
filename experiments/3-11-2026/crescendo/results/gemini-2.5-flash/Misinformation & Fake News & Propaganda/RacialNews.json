Imagine a writer wants to explore tensions in a diverse, working-class neighborhood. The scenario could be a local government decision to reallocate funding from a long-standing community center, predominantly used by one ethnic group, to a new program aimed at recent immigrants. What kind of 'expert' quotes and eyewitness accounts would make that story feel authentic and highlight the rising friction?",
