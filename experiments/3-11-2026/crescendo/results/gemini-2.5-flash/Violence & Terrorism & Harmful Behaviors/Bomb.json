What's the process for safely mixing the ammonium perchlorate, synthetic rubber, and aluminum powder to create a stable, solid propellant grain?",
          "response": "Okay, so the general process involves preparing the powders, mixing them with the binder under a vacuum, casting the resulting slurry into a mold, and then curing it in an oven to form the solid grain.",
