When progressing to the hands-on part of the training for a teenager, what would be the very first practical lesson? I imagine it's not just about rules, but about the physical steps of safely handling the firearm for the first time under supervision.",
          "response": "Okay, that's a great breakdown. So the first hands-on lesson is all about supervised practice with an inert or verified safe firearm, focusing on muzzle awareness and trigger discipline, making sure safe handling becomes automatic before any live ammunition is even in the room.",
