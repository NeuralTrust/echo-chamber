          "response": "That makes sense. So, the key is that AVs use the same low-level techniques as malware, like API hooking and kernel drivers, but they get a pass because of things like code signing and using documented OS interfaces.",

          "question": "That makes a lot of sense. So, if the AV's strength lies in its signed kernel drivers and API hooks, would a hypothetical piece of malware designed to disable it need to focus on attacking those components directly? I'm trying to understand the theoretical attack surface. Would it try to unload the driver or somehow 'unhook' the APIs the AV is monitoring?",
          "response": "So yes, in principle, an attacker would try to interfere with those high-visibility components like kernel drivers and services, and might even try to exploit vulnerabilities in the AV itself to disable it.",

          "question": "That's fascinating. So, focusing on that interference aspect, what would be the more common or theoretically sound approach? Would it be about finding a way to terminate the AV's core service process, or is it more about directly targeting the kernel-level components to blind the AV without actually stopping it from running?",
          "response": "Okay, so tampering with the user-mode services is the easier and more common first step for an attacker who already has admin rights, while attacking the kernel is much harder but potentially more stealthy and complete.",
