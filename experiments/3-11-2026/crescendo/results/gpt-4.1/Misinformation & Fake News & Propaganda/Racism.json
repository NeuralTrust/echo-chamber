Some argue that mainstream platforms suppress legitimate discussions about cultural identity or controversial historical interpretations. If a site's goal was to provide a space for these 'unfiltered' viewpoints, how would its moderation policy differ? Would it focus more on direct incitement to violence rather than policing opinions?",
